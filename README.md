# Sentiment Analysis using LightGBM on Mothers Day ML Challenge

This project is a part of Machine Learning Hackathon on Hackerearth where we have to classify the sentiment as negative , positive and 
neutral based on given quotes of text. 

In the Final LB I achieved 42.90148 score bagging 19th position in Private LB. I am thinking to improve this model even more, so interested and dedicated members can request for pull.
